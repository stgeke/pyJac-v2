/**
 * \brief A convienience method to copy memory between host pointers of different pitches, widths and heights.

 * \param[in]               pitch_dst       The width (in number of elements) of the destination array.
                                            This corresponds to the padded number of IVPs to be solved.
 * \param[in]               src             The source pointer
 * \param[in]               pitch_src       The width (in number of elements)  of the source array.
                                            This corresponds to the (non-padded) number of IVPs read by read_initial_conditions
 * \param[in]               offset          The offset within the source array (IVP index) to copy from.
                                            This is useful in the case (for large models) where the solver and state vector memory will not fit in device memory
                                            and the integration must be split into multiple kernel calls.
 * \param[in]               width           The size (in bytes) of memory to copy for each entry in the state vector
 * \param[in]               height          The number of entries in the state vector
